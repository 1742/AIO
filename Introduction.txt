[h1]All-in-One[/h1]
[b]Gestalt Crisis Ascension Mod[/b]

[hr]

[h1]Overview[/h1]
This mod provides a brand new Crisis Ascension path for [b]Gestalt Empires[/b] — [i][b]All-in-One[/b][/i]. It is a path of ascension achieved through Reality Editing and Applied Infinity. By completing the [i][b]Horizon Engine[/b][/i], surviving the Situation, and constructing the exclusive megastructure [i][b]Yog-Sothoth[/b][/i], you will ascend to master the laws of reality.

Although you will see many shadows of the vanilla ascension paths on this route [strike](What a cobbled-together crisis)[/strike], it now introduces a brand new [b]Directional Applied Infinity Thesis (DAIT)[/b] system. It is no longer just boring stat padding, but directly modifying the underlying code of the universe! [strike](Isn't that just a fancy way of saying buffs?...)[/strike]

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*]New Ascension Perk: [b]All-in-One[/b] and a Become the Crisis path.
[*]New [b]DAIT[/b] (Directional Applied Infinity Thesis) buff system.
[*]New Origin: All-in-One.
[*]New Megastructure: Yog-Sothoth.
[/list]

[h2]Core Gameplay: Law Editing (DAIT)[/h2]
Just like the three vanilla Crisis paths, you need to adopt three Ascension Perks before you can select [b]All-in-One[/b]. By accumulating [b]Transcendental Logic[/b], you are no longer simply researching technologies, but directly converting logic into empire modifiers.
The current Crisis Buffs are divided into three categories. You can switch between them at any time.
