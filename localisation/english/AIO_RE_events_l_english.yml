Although you may not be quite sure how the empty and dark space stirs up ripples, your "senses" answer you this way.\n\nA blurry array of golden, yellow and brown light spots emerged, forming a "low-resolution" pattern. As the resolution kept increasing, you found yourself standing in a huge classical library. It has no boundaries. On the distant dome is a constantly rotating but never-repeating star map. In an open space, a huge typewriter is slowly spitting out pages filled with unknown words and patterns. Each page is a world being written down.\n\nUnder Tawi's guidance, you enter a quiet study area. On the desk, a slender pen was placed on top of an open book. It has no ink, but when you pick it up, you know that as long as you write it down, the world will do the same.\n\nTawi stood opposite the desk, as if she was the sole guardian of this collection. Her gaze was gentle, yet she was looking at you with extraordinary concentration.\n\n"This is your control area - or, if you prefer a more classical name, you can also call it 'library'. From here, you can browse the world, edit reality, or... just tear off some paragraphs directly. Aforgomom will do it for you. However, I suggest you not use that pen too frequently. It won't remind you when you 'made a mistake'.""
