<h2>Overview</h2>
This mod provides a brand new Crisis Ascension path for **Gestalt Empires** — <i><b>All-in-One</b></i>. It is a path of ascension achieved through Reality Editing and Applied Infinity. By completing the <i><b>Horizon Engine</b></i>, surviving the Situation, and constructing the exclusive megastructure <i><b>Yog-Sothoth</b></i>, you will ascend to master the laws of reality.
<br>
Although you will see many shadows of the vanilla ascension paths on this route <del>(What a cobbled-together crisis)</del>, after repeated torment by the author (and AI), it now introduces a brand new **Directional Applied Infinity Thesis** system (DAIT). It is no longer just boring stat padding, but directly modifying the underlying code of the universe! <del>(Isn't that just a fancy way of saying buffs?...)</del>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>New Ascension Perk: <b>All-in-One</b> and a Become the Crisis path.</li>
<li>New <b>DAIT</b> (Directional Applied Infinity Thesis) buff system.</li>
<li>New Origin: All-in-One.</li>
<li>New Megastructure: Yog-Sothoth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Gameplay: Law Editing</h2>
Just like the three vanilla Crisis paths, you need to adopt three Ascension Perks before you can select <b>All-in-One</b>. By accumulating <b>Transcendental Logic</b>, you are no longer simply researching technologies, but directly converting **Transcendental Logic** into empire modifiers.
<br>
The current Crisis Buffs are divided into three categories. You can switch between them at any time, and their power scales linearly (at lower values) based on your **Transcendental Logic** output.

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Crisis Level 1</h3>
Unlocked upon adoption:
<ul>
<li><b>Exponential Learning Theory:</b> Unlocks the Matryoshka Brain District (Recursive Node). Infinite build limit, produces Research and Unity.</li>
<li><b>Horizon Engine:</b> Produces Energy and Dark Matter to prepare for what comes next. <del>(Yes, it's still the Aetherophasic Engine's cousin)</del>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crisis Level 2</h3>
Unlocked after completing the <i><b>Horizon Engine</b></i>:
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to the <i><b>Ultimate Gate</b></i>. Note: The <i><b>Ultimate Gate</b></i> has a high Energy upkeep, and starting the <b>Merge Cosmos</b> Situation adds a dynamic Energy upkeep on top of that.</li>
<li><b>Strategy:</b> Before upgrading, build several silos to stockpile the Energy and Dark Matter produced by the <i>Horizon Engine</i>. Once the Situation starts, select <b>Vacuum Zero-Point Level</b> (Boosts job Energy output) in the **DAIT** menu to prevent an economic crash.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Merge Cosmos Situation</h4>
You need to spend massive amounts of Energy Credits and Dark Matter to advance the Situation. While the Situation is progressing, you can use **DAIT** to gain various benefits.
<ul>
<li><b>Stage 1 Complete:</b> Unlocks the <b>Ultimate Gate Node</b>. A Gateway that can be built anywhere, ignoring borders. (However, Paradox may have changed the megastructure mechanics so you cannot build megastructures in unreachable systems. Currently, this function only works where your Construction Ships can physically reach... or you can use a Quantum Catapult to yeet your ships there...)</li>
<li><b>Stage 2 Complete:</b> Unlocks the special system <i><b>The Nameless Mist</b></i>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crisis Level 3-5</h3>
Continue upgrading your megastructure: <i><b>Silver Key</b></i> -> <i><b>Eternal Throne</b></i> -> <i><b>Yog-Sothoth</b></i>.
<br>
Each level increases the base amount of <b>Transcendental Logic</b> provided by the megastructure, raising the floor of your **DAIT** values. By the final stage, the fleets of the entire galaxy combined won't be enough to fight you—after all, you are fighting them with a cheat engine.
<br>
Completing Stage 7 finishes the Ascension and grants victory. If you choose to continue playing, you can use Yog-Sothoth to edit reality at will:
<ul>
<li>Change celestial body types</li>
<li>Change other empires' governments</li>
<li>Delete celestial bodies</li>
<li>Delete the Galaxy</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<i>Note: Due to the inability to build megastructures in unreachable systems, some post-victory functions may be buggy.</i>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modified Automated Buildings logic.</li>
</ul>
If you have other mods that modify these contents, please place this mod <b>above</b> them (load earlier) or check for conflicts.
<br>
This mod involves removing celestial bodies and ships, which may cause event chains in other mods to get stuck if their target planets/ships are erroneously removed.
<br>
<b>CRITICAL WARNING:</b> Do NOT use modded Map Types! This will prevent <i><b>The Nameless Mist</b></i> system from spawning, blocking the Situation progress!
<br>

Finally, enjoy the game!
